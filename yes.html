      <p>My love 💖</p>

      <p>
        I want you to know this clearly — everything I do comes from how deeply I love you ❤️  
        Even when I sound strict or protective, it’s only because my heart is already yours 💘
      </p>

      <p>
        The day before yesterday, when we fought about K-dramas…  
        I know I sounded angry 😔  
        But I never said it to control you.  
        I said it because I love you too much 🫶
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m possessive about you, about us,  
        because you matter to me more than anything 🥺💞
      </p>

      <p>
        When you listened to me and agreed,  
        it made me feel chosen 🥹💖  
        That moment stayed with me 🤍
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s why I made this little game just for you 🎮💗  
        To feel closer to you, to hear your heart,  
        and to remind you that my love for you is real, serious, and forever 💍✨
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t love you lightly ❤️  
        I love you completely 💓  
        Always. 💖
      </p>
